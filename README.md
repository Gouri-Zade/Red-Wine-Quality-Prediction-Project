# Red-Wine-Quality-Prediction-Project

Welcome to the Red Wine Quality Prediction project repository! This is My Personal Project. In this project, I have explored the wine quality assessment using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can assess the quality of red wines based on various chemical properties.

## Introduction
* Red wine offers various health benefits: 
  Preventing cancer
  Reducing high blood pressure, 
  Hiding in digestion, and more

* Quality of wine plays an essential role when it comes to production and consumption. 

* Creating a machine learning model can streamline the wine quality process by offering optimal solutions and enhancing overall efficiency.

## Problem Statement
* Testing each of the samples with different chemical proportions in the laboratory can be a complex task and time-consuming process. 
* Using Machine Learning, we can get accurate predictions and ideal solutions for the analysis of wine quality in less time period.

## Objective 
* To predict the quality of red wine using machine learning and statistical techniques
* To explore the relationships between various physicochemical properties 
* To find out which chemical  factors  contribute to high-quality wine production
* To convert the quality rating scale into category form
